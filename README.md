This Repository holds various custom plugins for the Software [Nuke](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke-family/nuke) from the Foundry.


## Plugins

- [CircularRamp](https://vimeo.com/640930193) creates a radial falloff on a user defined center. The Falloff itself can be rotated and will always be full frame. It is intended rather as a technical help than directly used as an image.

- [Vibrant](https://vimeo.com/637353122) is a masked saturation operation, which adds colorfullness to less saturated parts of the image while affecting already saturated parts less.

## Credits 
- The adapted cmake setup and batch files were setup by [Jonas Sorgenfrei](https://github.com/jonassorgenfrei) originally on the [DeepC](https://github.com/charlesangus/DeepC) repository.
