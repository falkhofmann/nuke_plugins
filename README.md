## Pre-compiled binaries
- In the [release](https://github.com/falkhofmann/nuke_plugins/releases) scetion are pre-compiled files for Linux from Nuke 11.3 > 13.1.


## Build yourself
- The batchInstall.sh file should help to build these yourself for Linux or Windows.
- I have set up the building on CentOS 7 with devtoolset-7 and cmake 3.16.x

## Credits 
- The adapted cmake setup and batch files were setup by [Jonas Sorgenfrei](https://github.com/jonassorgenfrei) originally on the [DeepC](https://github.com/charlesangus/DeepC) repository.
